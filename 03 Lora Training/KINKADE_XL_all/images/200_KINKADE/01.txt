An image of a house with a Christmas tree
A snow-covered house with a green roof is surrounded by a snow-covered yard, featuring a large window and a door. The house is in a residential area with a street and a parked car nearby. Two people are present, one on the left and one on the right, possibly enjoying the winter scenery or attending to the house.
The image depicts a snowy street in front of a large, white house. The house is adorned with a wreath on the door, and a light is shining on the front door. The street is lined with trees, creating a picturesque winter scene. There are two people visible in the scene, one standing closer to the left side of the image and the other near the center. A bench can be seen on the right side of the image, adding to the cozy atmosphere of the scene.
